# This code demonstrates a simplified implementation of a Vickrey auction using the SigmaProofs package.
# A Vickrey auction is a type of sealed-bid auction where the highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest bid price.

# Range proofs can be used to prove that a bid falls within a certain range without revealing the actual bid value.
# This is crucial for maintaining bid privacy while allowing verification of auction results.

# Auction process overview:
# 1. Setup: An authority generates and publishes a public key for bid encryption.
# 2. Bidding: Participants submit their bids encrypted using ElGamal encryption with the authority's public key.
# 3. Winner determination: The authority decrypts bids, determines the winner, and reveals the second-highest bid.
# 4. Verification: The authority provides zero-knowledge proofs to verify the auction results without revealing individual bids.

# Note: In a full implementation, additional steps would be needed:
# - Participant registration and key generation
# - Bid signing so that dealer could enforce the obligations for the winning bid
# - Bid commitment so that a malicious dealer would not steal the winning bid. A simple hash commitment would do here.
